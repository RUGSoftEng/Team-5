# Learning team (Team-5)
The problem of learning facts is that this process is boring, and that the learned information is forgotten if facts are not rehearsed at the right moment. This affects not only students, who could have trouble learning and often forget the material over time, but also teachers, who have difficulty presenting the material to be learned in an interesting fashion, and rely on their students remembering the material taught to them. The bottom line of the problem is that the method students use for learning, if any, is inefficient.
