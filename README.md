# Learning team (Team-5)
The problem of learning facts is that this process is boring, and that the learned information is forgotten if facts are not rehearsed at the right moment. This affects not only students, who could have trouble learning and often forget the material over time, but also teachers, who have difficulty presenting the material to be learned in an interesting fashion, and rely on their students remembering the material taught to them. The bottom line of the problem is that the method students use for learning, if any, is inefficient. 

# How to run guide
In order to start the SlimStampen app, you can download the directory with the executable for your platform of choice from the Github website. 

### Windows

### Apple Mac OSX
Download all files as ZIP from GitHub, unzip the files on your computer, open the folder _/executables/SlimStampen-darwin-x64/_ and run the file SlimStampen.app.

### Linux

# Download source files
Another method is to download all files from GitHub and run the program in Electron by following these steps:
## Clone the repository
Clone this repository using the following command in a Git bash and run it in Electron.

```
git clone https://github.com/RUGSoftEng/Team-5

## Compile the code
In order to compile the code, you need NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. We recommend using the Node Package Manager (npm). In the directory with the cloned source code, run the following commands to start the program in Electron.
