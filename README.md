# Language learning team (Team-5)
Although almost no one likes it, having your factual knowledge in order is essential to become an expert in almost all realms of life, whether it is learning a new language from scratch, or expanding an already high level of expertise. Adaptive learning systems can significantly improve the learning speed by calibrating the learning speed to the expertise of the learner - practicing those items most that this specific learner finds difficult. At the departments of Psychology and Artificial Intelligence, one such system, called SlimStampen, has been developed by dr. Van Rijn that improves learning gains by 10 to 20%.
